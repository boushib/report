        <h1>The Thunder Are Playing Way Better, But Are They A Real Contender?</h1>
        <img src="./img/img-1.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Roll back the calendar a couple months, and things weren’t going so well in <i>Oklahoma City</i>. The
            Thunder had to open their season without former MVP Russell Westbrook, who was in the final stages of his
            knee rehabilitation following a late-summer arthroscopic procedure. And even after getting him back a few
            games in, the club struggled out of the gate, beginning 0-4 and becoming the last team in the Western
            Conference to claim its first victory.</p>

        <p>Fast-forward to <b>Christmas</b>, the Thunder are currently one of the NBA’s hottest teams; winners in 21 of
            their last 28. Paul George has played MVP-level ball, averaging 32 points on 53 percent shooting the past
            few weeks. And Oklahoma City has the league’s second-best defense, a notable stat since Andre Roberson,
            perhaps the team’s best defender, has missed the entire season.</p>
        <p>With OKC a game out of first in the West, and no one separating themselves as the top challenger to the
            Warriors, it’s time to ask: Have the Thunder become legitimate contenders?</p>

        <p>The answer, to this point, is something of a mixed bag. Yes, the defense has been downright dominant at
            times, and their overall net rating suggests they belong in the conversation. But the offense — slightly
            below average, and still with considerable flaws beyond Westbrook, George, Steven Adams and Dennis Schroder
            — doesn’t enjoy that same level of success each night.</p>
        <p>There’s no question about this team’s most abundant strength. Its imposing length and eye-popping
            athleticism stands out even more now, with Jerami Grant starting and Nerlens Noel and rookie Hamidou Diallo
            getting minutes off the bench (and without Carmelo Anthony as a weak link teams can attack relentlessly in
            screen-and-rolls). And aside from largely negating pick-and-rolls — third in efficiency against them1 — the
            Thunder get their hands on just about everything, ranking second in the NBA in deflections, and second in
            recovered loose balls. Oklahoma City is lightning quick and has a ton of collective hustle among its
            youngsters, making it tough to score even in situations that would normally present easy fast-break
            opportunities. One sign of that: After forcing a Thunder turnover.</p>
        <div class="page-break">page break</div>
        <h2 class="new-page">The club addressed one of its biggest problems over the years</h2>
        <p>The club addressed one of its biggest problems over the years — the awful bench depth — when it acquired
            Schroder in the deal to dump Anthony. But on some level, OKC’s main problem now is the same as it ever was:
            In a league where basically everyone can shoot from outside, the Thunder still struggle mightily from
            distance. They’re tied for second worst in 3-point accuracy, and Westbrook — while he’s cut down
            considerably on his long, midrange 2’s — is on pace to have one of the worst volume 3-point shooting
            campaigns of all-time, at just 23.6 percent on nearly five attempts from deep per game. As such, OKC ranks
            in the bottom 10 in effective field goal percentage, the lone contender in that group among several teams
            likely to make the lottery.</p>
        <p>There’s obvious room for upside. Beyond the continued hope that Roberson will rejoin them at some point this
            season, the Thunder also have one of the youngest rotations in the NBA. They have seven players who are 25
            or younger and have logged at least 300 minutes already.</p>
        <p>If there’s a downside, it’s that Oklahoma City hasn’t been thoroughly tested from a scheduling standpoint
            yet. In fact, only Boston has played an easier slate to this point. According to a preseason BPI tracker,
            the Thunder’s projected winning percentage was expected to get progressively worse each month after
            December because of the escalating schedule to come. (Another possible challenge, though OKC would love to
            get Roberson back from injury, would be the potential spacing problems upon Roberson’s return. There’s
            already limited shooting on the floor, and his unwillingness to pull the trigger would further hinder the
            effort to fix that conundrum.)</p>
        <div class="page-break">page break</div>
        <h3 class="new-page">Time will tell whether those projections were merely an overshoot.</h3>
        <p>Nonetheless, FiveThirtyEight’s newly updated projection model really seems to like the Thunder’s chances of
            becoming Golden State’s most viable challenger out West. Despite the incredibly solid Denver Nuggets’
            turnaround, which has them virtually tied for first place, the system gives Oklahoma City a 10 percent
            probability of making it to the NBA Finals, more than double that of any other Western Conference team.</p>
        <p>Time will tell whether those projections were merely an overshoot. But for the time being, after a slow
            start this season and two consecutive first-round flameouts the past two years, the Thunder will gladly
            take making it onto Santa’s nice list heading into their Christmas Day game.</p>
